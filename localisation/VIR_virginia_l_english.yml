VIR_washington_is_second_to_the_congress_desc:0 "Truth be told, as great as Washington is, he is not without flaws. In addition, surely the collective intelligence of the new Congress will exceed Washington's. There's no reason we need to bow to his will."
VIR_humanity_over_economy:0 "Humanity Over Economy"
VIR_humanity_over_economy_desc:0 "Although limited emancipation has been, put bluntly, damaging to our nation's economy, we've seen multiple considerable benefits to our nation as a whole. We now have a new source of conscript able manpower, with a loyal base grateful to be free in comparison to its Southern neighbors. We can also teach them the Christian way, and get them from working in the fields to working in the smiths. We must put aside our agrarian ways and move towards an industrial future."
VIR_consolidate_southern_influence:0 "Consolidate Southern Influence"
VIR_consolidate_southern_influence_desc:0 "Our Southern brothers are in desperate need of allies, and we posses quite the strong nation to protect and guide them. We'd do well to form a coalition of defense."

VIR_negroes_are_not_to_be_free_desc:0 "There has been much discussion over the fate of the Negro. Some begin to feel for our darker skinned brothers, arguing their time for emancipation is nigh. Unfortunately, there is simply too much to lose by emancipation. Although the situation is not desirable, and our God above is surely disgruntled by it, we must continue our mastery over the Negro race, for the greater good of Virginia."
VIR_washington_is_second_to_god:0 "Washington Is Second To God"
VIR_washington_is_second_to_god_desc:0 "As amazing as Washington is, we must remember as a nation that he is not the Almighty. He is a mere creation of him, and God is the one we all must truly glorify and let lead this nation."
VIR_washington_shall_not_be_questioned:0 "Washington Shall Not be Questioned"
VIR_washington_shall_not_be_questioned_desc:0 "With the military prowess of George Washington, there is practically nothing stopping us from absolutely dominating the New World. Once our military is in tip-top shape, we can move to forcefully unite the states."
VIR_disregard_the_north:0 "Disregard the North"
VIR_disregard_the_north_desc:0 "The North has unabashedly proven to be contrasted to our southern interest of slavery. To better our prospects as an agrarian nation, we must seek out those like us."
VIR_washingtons_opinion_comes_first:0 "Washington's Opinion Comes First"
VIR_washingtons_opinion_comes_first_desc:0 "If he will not take direct power, we can at least take his word on nearly every issue. Although he'll likely try to remain disconnected, he's sure to at least have thoughts about what actions we take."
VIR_force_washington_in_charge:0 "Force Washington In Charge"
VIR_force_washington_in_charge_desc:0 "Put simply, our nation is hopeless without a strong leader. And there is no stronger leader than George Washington. We gambled the Revolution on him, and we'd be making a safe bet to let him rule Virginia, whether he likes it or not."
VIR_virginia_behind_washington:0 "Virginia Behind Washington"
VIR_virginia_behind_washington_desc:0 "Our new nation has, by greater happenstance, been lead by the greatest military general the New World has ever seen.

VIR_give_in_to_washingtons_demands:0 "Give in to Washington's Demands"
VIR_give_in_to_washingtons_demands_desc:0 "Perhaps Washington is right when he asks not to be instated as an all-powerful leader. Although he is more than qualified for the position, after all, we did fight a great war to evade such tyranny."
VIR_reconsider_our_negro_stance:0 "Reconsider Our Negro Stance"
VIR_reconsider_our_negro_stance_desc:0 "The Negros currently working our fields are currently a part of a greater moral dilemma in this nation. Was Jefferson serious when he said "All men are created equal"? If so, we've got to restructure our economy to wean off slaves. We've been doing good work so far, but eventually, these men must be free to enter our factories. It's the moral thing to do."
VIR_get_comfy_with_the_south:0 "Get Comfy With the South"

VIR_make_northern_amends:0 "Make Northern Amends"
VIR_make_northern_amends_desc:0 "We must absolutely disregard our previous distaste for Northerners. If we are to seriously contend in the New World geopolitical scene, we must make friends with our former comrades, not enemies. We saw how well they fought against the British."
VIR_open_ourselves_to_a_northern_coalition:0 "Open Ourselves to a Northern Coalition"
VIR_open_ourselves_to_a_northern_coalition_desc:0 "Admittedly, we could serve much better working with the North distinctively as oppose to the South. Although we've had a history of unity with our southern brothers, they seem a bit backwards in their ways, as opposed to the modern, industrial, and powerful North. Working with them will come with extensive benefit to us."
VIR_uniting_america_under_washington:0 "Uniting America, Under Washington"
VIR_uniting_america_under_washington_desc:0 "The leader of America needs to be strong, powerful, and proven. There is no one else other than Washington for that role. Although many of our Southern bretheren were able to see that, so many Northerners couldn't unite with "slavery" or "agrarianism". It's about time we take our values to them by force!"
VIR_subdue_the_negroes:0 "Subdue The Negroes"
VIR_subdue_the_negroes_desc:0 "We must ensure that our slaves do not ever consider revolution. The march of progress is much too important to be stopped by "morals" or "humanity". Any opposition will be stamped out as soon as it springs."

VIR_washington_a_born_prophet_desc:0 "The glorious God above has quite obviously bestowed George Washington among us as a holy prophet to guide us sheep to the great pastures of heavenly glory. If we shall follow in his tracks, we shall prevail above all mortals."

VIR_unifying_the_south:0 "Unifying the South"
VIR_unifying_the_south_desc:0 "Our holy Southern, with such strong shared ancestry and tradition, will easily see Washington as a natural prophet, just as we have. Although their flirt with independence was notable, it's about time they put their fun aside and assimilate into our holy state."
VIR_the_north_shall_submit:0 "The North Shall Submit"
VIR_the_north_shall_submit_desc:0 "Our arrogant brothers of the north are showing stubborn resistance to our holy nation. Do they not remember Washington created them? Just as easily, he can and will erase them, as it is God's will."
VIR_to_the_pacific:0 "To The Pacific"
VIR_to_the_pacific_desc:0 "As any good religion should, we must now move to spread our religion across the New World. Even if they resist, their deaths will be justified in the name of our Lord, more specifically, through the wise teaching of Washington."
VIR_disgarding_negro_lives:0 "Disgarding Negro Lives"
VIR_disgarding_negro_lives_desc:0 "Who said the negroes were human? I don't think that was ever a realistic argument. They're as savage as the Savages in the New World, and they're both as savage as the animals we walk above every day. There is no reason we should treat them with any civility."
VIR_absorbing_our_southern_brothers:0 "Absorbing our Southern Brothers"
VIR_absorbing_our_southern_brothers_desc:0 "Our southern brothers are too similar to stay separated for any longer. It is the greatest imperative of our state to move south and absorb our brothers below, using force if necessary."
VIR_revisiting_territorial_claims:0 "Revisiting Territorial Claims"
VIR_revisiting_territorial_claims_desc:0 "The Savages of the New World have made quite a disgrace of the territory we once imagined as ours. Put simply, the territory would be much better in our hands..."
